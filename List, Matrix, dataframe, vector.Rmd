#This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

#Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

#Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

#When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

#The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, # the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.




## Creating a vector
```{r}
# Numeric
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
x
```
```{r}
# Character
y <- c("red", "blue", "green", "no color")
y
```

```{r}
# numeric and character
x <- c(1,2.2, "blue")
x
```

```{r}
# To find the lenght of vector
length(x)
```
```{r}
# Create vector using sequence
x <- seq(from= 2, to = 10, by = 2)
x
```
## Factors
```{r}
s <- c(0,1,3,4,5,3,4,5,2,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,4)
s
```
```{r}
sf <- factor(s)
sf
```
## List
```{r}
x <- list(diagnosis= "Gastritis", age= 79, medication = TRUE)
x
```
```{r}
x$age
x$medication
```
```{r}
length(x)
```
## Matrices
```{r}
# Create matrix with 6 elements
y <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
y
```

```{r}
# Create a matrix with 10 elements
y <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2)
y
```

```{r}
# Create matrix with 4 elements
cells <- c(2,3,5,12,30,31)
colname <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar")
rowname <- c("Apple", "Orange")
y <- matrix(cells, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(rowname, colname))
y
```
## DataFrame
```{r}
hospital <- c("New York", "California")
patients <- c(150, 350)
df <- data.frame(hospital, patients)
df
```

```{r}
# To Look the structure of dataset
str(df)
```
